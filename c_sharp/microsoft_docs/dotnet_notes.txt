.NET FRAMEWORK
==============

- .NET is the entire framework and is composed of these parts starting from the bottom of the architecture...




COMMON LANGUAGE RUNTIME [CLR]
=============================

- There needs to be a way to translate the code coming out of .NET into machine instructions.
- This is the job the CLR.
- The CLR is a virtual machine component of .NET that compile INTERMEDIATE LANGUAGE [IL]* into NATIVE CODE/MACHINE INSTRUCTIONS.
    
    * INTERMEDIATE LANGUAGE [IL]
    ----------------------------

    - IL is a term given to a language that is used in a compiler with the purpose of translating high-level programming languages like C# into NATIVE CODE that the machine can understand and thus be instructed to take certain actions.




FRAMEWORK CLASS LIBRARY [FCL]
=============================

- In order to understand the FCL, we need to understand the...

    * COMMON LANGUAGE INFRASTRUCTURE [CLI]
    --------------------------------------

    - The CLI Is an open specification developed by Microsoft and standardized by ISO and ECMA [European Computer Manufacturers Association].
    - It describes executable code and a runtime environment that allows multiple high-level languages to be used on different computer platforms without being rewritten for specific architectures. This implies it is platform agnostic.
    - The CLI ensures that high-level programming languages can be compiled to IL, which then can be compiled to native code.

- The FCL is the FIRST IMPLEMENTATION of the CLI. It provides a foundational set of STANDARD LIBRARIES*.

    * STANDARD LIBRARIES
    --------------------

    - The Standard Libraries of the CLI encapsulate a large number of common functions, such as file reading and writing, XML document manipulation, exception handling, application globalization, network communication, threading and reflection, which makes the programmer's job easier.

- In particular, the FCL implements the BASE CLASS LIBRARY, which holds the following libraries:
    - System
    - System.Collections
    - System.Collections.Generic
    - System.Diagnostics
    - System.Globalization

- And so one. See the full list: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Libraries_(CLI)#Base_Class_Library




WINDOWS FORMS [WINFORMS]
========================

- Winforms is a graphical (GUI) class library included as a part of Microsoft .NET Framework or Mono Framework, providing a platform to write rich client applications for desktop, laptop, and tablet PCs. While it is seen as a replacement for the earlier and more complex C++ based Microsoft Foundation Class Library, it does not offer a comparable paradigm and only acts as a platform for the user interface tier in a multi-tier solution.




ASP.NET
=======

- is an open-source server-side web application framework designed for web development to produce dynamic web pages developed by Microsoft to allow programmers to build dynamic web sites, applications and services.
- ASP = Active Server Pages.
