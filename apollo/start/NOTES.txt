CURSOR BASED PAGINATION
=======================

In cursor-based pagination, a "cursor" is used to keep track of where in the data set the next items should
be fetched from. Sometimes the cursor can be quite simple and just refer to the ID of the last object
fetched, but in some cases - ex lists sorted according to some criteria = the cursor needs to 
encode the sorting criteria in addition to the ID of the last object fetched.

Implementing cursor-based pagination on the client isn't all that different from offset-based pagination,
but instead of using an absolute offset, we keep a reference to the last object fetched and information 
about the sort order used.
