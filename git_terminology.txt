REBASE
======

- Rebasing essentially takes a set of commits, "copies" them, and plops them down somewhere else.



HEAD
====

- HEAD is the symbolic name for the currently checked out commit -- it's essentially what commit you're working on top of.
- HEAD always points to the most recent commit which is reflected in the working tree.
- The advantage of rebasing is that it can be used to make a nice linear sequence of commits. 
	The commit log / history of the repository will be a lot cleaner if only rebasing is allowed.
